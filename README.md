# Stopwatch
This is a simple web-based stopwatch application with lap timer functionality. It allows users to start, pause, reset the stopwatch, record laps, and clear lap records. Each lap is displayed with a timestamp and can be removed individually also.
In this project, I designed and developed a responsive stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to accurately measure and record time intervals with features such as start, pause, reset, and lap times.
I have used
- HTML5 for structuring the application's elements
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript for implementing stopwatch functionality and interactivity

Key Features

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices
- Start, pause, and reset stopwatch functionality
- Lap time tracking and display
- Interactive and user-friendly interface
